Firstly "images" and "styles" branches were merged into the develop branch. There was a merge conflict with index.html, which was successfuly resolved.

## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a collection of philosophies, methodologies and toolsets that help businesses deliver applications more quickly and cost-effectively.
DevOps helps companies accelerate time-to-market, improve software quality and reduce costs by eliminating independent functional and administrative silos,
and automating change management, configuration management and deployment processes.
DevOps also may be described as a link between development, quality assurance (QA) and other departments.
Another aspect of DevOps is a phenomenon in which skilled professionals automate formerly manual processes, where developers become users of their own software,
and manual labor related to an infrastructure becomes unnecessary. 
New technologies, like cloud computing, have expanded what is possible in DevOps, and the approach has become popular in the tech community.
